# Midnight Network Tools

A flexible set of tools for launching **well-known networks, custom networks, and dynamic local environments**, as well as **performing state changes** against those networks (image upgrades now, runtime upgrades and hard forks coming soon).

This project provides a unified way to spin up Midnight resources for development, testing, and experimentation.

---

## Features

- Launch dockerized **well-known Midnight networks** (e.g. `qanet`, `devnet`, `govnet`, `testnet-02`, etc.)
- Perform **state-changing operations** such as image upgrades (runtime upgrades and hard forks planned).
- Launch a fully **dynamic local environment** with sped-up Cardano resources for quick testing of Partner Chains/Cardano capabilities.

---

## Usage

All functionality is available via npm/yarn scripts defined in `package.json`.

### Launching Networks

You can run different Midnight networks locally with:

```bash
npm run run:qanet
npm run run:devnet
npm run run:govnet
npm run run:testnet-02
npm run run:node-dev-01
```

### Upgrading Networks

You can also launch a network and immediately apply image upgrades:

```bash
npm run image-upgrade:qanet
npm run image-upgrade:devnet
npm run image-upgrade:govnet
npm run image-upgrade:testnet-02
npm run image-upgrade:node-dev-01
```

### Stopping Networks

To stop any running network:

```bash
npm run stop:qanet
npm run stop:devnet
npm run stop:govnet
npm run stop:testnet-02
npm run stop:node-dev-01
```

### Fork Testing

See [fork-testing.md](../docs/fork-testing.md)

### Local Environment

In addition to well-known networks, you can launch a dynamic local environment that connects multiple components together.

### Local env – step by step
> **Warning:** Public use of Local env is currently disabled, until we publish Governance Smart Contracts. For anyone who already has acccess,
you need to clone [midnight-reserve-contracts](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-reserve-contracts) to the same location where midnight-node repo sits.

> **Note:** Local development environments set `ALLOW_NON_SSL=true` to allow connections to PostgreSQL without SSL certificates. Production deployments require SSL.

When first run, all images are pulled from public repositories. This may take some time.

The stack is built and started. A Cardano node begins block production from a pre-configured genesis file (private testnet, no public connectivity).

Once Cardano is synced, Ogmios and DB-Sync connect and begin syncing.

pc-contracts-cli inserts D parameter values and registers Midnight Node keys with Cardano.

Once Postgres is populated, Midnight nodes begin block production after 2 main chain epochs.

Starting the environment

To start the environment via Earthly:

```bash
earthly +start-local-env-latest
```

Or specify a released node image:

```bash
earthly +start-local-env --NODE-IMAGE=ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/midnight-node:0.12.0
```

You can also use npm scripts:

```bash
npm run run:local-env
npm run run:local-env-with-indexer
```

Stopping the environment

When stopping, volumes must also be wiped (persistent state is not supported yet).

```bash
earthly +stop-local-env-latest
```

# or

```bash
earthly +stop-local-env --NODE-IMAGE=ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/midnight-node:0.12.0
```
