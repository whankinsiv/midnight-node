# Image Attestation Operational Runbook

This runbook covers operational procedures for the image attestation and SBOM infrastructure.

## Normal Attestation Flow

During a normal release, the following occurs automatically:

1. **Build**: Multi-architecture images are built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
2. **Push**: Images are pushed to GHCR and Docker Hub
3. **Attest**: Build provenance attestation is created via `actions/attest-build-provenance`
4. **SBOM**: Syft generates an SPDX-JSON SBOM
5. **Scan**: Grype scans for vulnerabilities (fails on critical)
6. **SBOM Attest**: The SBOM is attested to the image via `actions/attest-sbom`

All steps must succeed for the release to complete.

## Monitoring

### GitHub Actions

Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for attestation and scanning jobs:

- [Main workflow](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node/actions/workflows/main.yml)
- [Release workflow](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node/actions/workflows/release-image.yml)

Look for these steps in the publish jobs:

- `Attest build provenance`
- `Attest SBOM` / `sbom-scan`

### GitHub Attestation API

Verify attestations are being created:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/midnight-node:TAG --owner midnightntwrk
```

## Troubleshooting

### Attestation Failures

#### Symptoms

- `Attest build provenance` step fails
- Error: "Error: Unauthorized" or "Error: Resource not accessible by integration"

#### Investigation

1. Review workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the workflow has `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` permissions
3. Check GitHub status at https://www.githubstatus.com/

#### Resolution

**Permission issue:**

Ensure the workflow job has the required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  attestations: write
```

**Transient failure (GitHub outage):**

Re-run the failed job. Check GitHub status at https://www.githubstatus.com/.

**Registry authentication failure:**

Verify registry credentials are configured in repository secrets:

- `MIDNIGHTCI_PACKAGES_WRITE` for GHCR
- `DOCKERHUB_MIDNIGHTNTWRK_USER` and `DOCKERHUB_MIDNIGHTNTWRK_TOKEN` for Docker Hub

### SBOM Generation Failures

#### Symptoms

- `sbom-scan` job fails during "Generate SBOM" step
- Error: "failed to catalog"

#### Investigation

1. Check if the image exists and is accessible
2. Review Syft error output for specific failures
3. Check for timeout issues on large images

#### Resolution

**Image not found:**

Ensure the image was pushed successfully before the SBOM job runs. Check job dependencies in the workflow.

**Timeout:**

Large images may timeout. The script retries 3 times with exponential backoff.

**Unsupported image format:**

Syft supports OCI and Docker image formats. Verify the image is in a supported format.

### Vulnerability Scan Failures

#### Symptoms

- `sbom-scan` job fails during "Scan for vulnerabilities" step
- Output shows vulnerabilities with critical severity

#### Investigation

1. Review the vulnerability summary in the job output
2. Download the `*-scan-results` artifact for full details
3. Check if vulnerabilities are in base images or application code

#### Resolution

**Option 1: Fix the vulnerability**

Update the affected package to a patched version:

```dockerfile
# For apt packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name=fixed-version

# For npm packages
RUN npm update vulnerable-package

# For Rust packages
# Update Cargo.lock with patched version
```

**Option 2: Temporarily ignore (with justification)**

If no fix is available, add to `.grype.yaml`:

```yaml
ignore:
  # CVE-YYYY-XXXXX: Description of vulnerability
  # Impact assessment: Explain why this is acceptable to ignore
  # Affected component: What package/binary is affected
  # Tracking: https://github.com/upstream/repo/issues/XXX
  # TODO: Remove when upstream releases fix
  - vulnerability: CVE-YYYY-XXXXX
```

**Requirements for ignoring vulnerabilities:**

1. Document the CVE ID and description
2. Assess and document the risk/impact
3. Link to upstream tracking issue
4. Add TODO with removal criteria
5. Create a tracking issue in this repository

### SBOM Attestation Failures

#### Symptoms

- `sbom-scan` job fails during "Attest SBOM" step
- Error: "Error: Unauthorized"

#### Investigation

1. Verify the image digest is correct
2. Check that the job has `attestations: write` permission
3. Check GitHub status

#### Resolution

Same as attestation failures — ensure `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` permissions are set.

**Fork PR:**

Attestation is automatically skipped for fork PRs (they don't have the required permissions). This is expected behavior.

### SBOM Size Limit Exceeded

#### Symptoms

- `sbom-scan` job fails during "Attest SBOM" step
- Error: `predicate file exceeds maximum allowed size: 16777216 bytes`

#### Investigation

1. Check the "Trim SBOM for attestation" step output for size details
2. If the trimmed SBOM exceeds 16MB, the image has grown significantly in package count

### SBOM Size Limit Exceeded

2. Consider stripping additional optional SPDX fields (e.g., `annotations`, `externalDocumentRefs`)
3. Review whether the base image can be slimmed down to reduce package count
4. Track upstream progress on increasing the limit: [actions/attest-sbom#168](https://github.com/actions/attest-sbom/issues/168)

## Managing CVE Ignores

### Adding an Ignore

1. Assess the vulnerability: `grype ghcr.io/midnight-ntwrk/midnight-node:TAG --output json | jq '.matches[] | select(.vulnerability.id == "CVE-YYYY-XXXXX")'`
2. Create tracking issue documenting CVE ID, severity, affected component, impact assessment, and upstream fix status
3. Add to `.grype.yaml` with required comments (see "Option 2" above for format)
4. Create PR referencing the tracking issue

### Removing an Ignore

When a fix becomes available: update the package, remove the ignore entry, close the tracking issue, and create a PR with all changes.

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Vulnerability in Production

1. Assess which versions/deployments are affected
2. Alert operators via appropriate channels
3. Create hotfix release or document mitigation steps
4. Push fixed images through normal pipeline

### GitHub Attestation Service Outage

Check status at https://www.githubstatus.com/. If attestation steps fail due to a GitHub outage, the build will fail — images cannot be published without attestations. Wait for the outage to resolve and re-run the workflow.
