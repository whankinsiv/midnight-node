# Add welcome contract e2e test

Ports the welcome contract from midnight-contracts and drives
deploy -> add_participant -> check_in through the full
compile/prove/submit/on-chain-verify pipeline. Adds a config template and a
`generate_intent_deploy_with_args` helper for passing constructor arguments.

Also fixes `prerequisites_ready` to match the compact variant directory by
major.minor.patch (previously major.minor), without which all contract e2e
tests silently skip.

The welcome constructor is simplified from the upstream
`Vector<5000, Maybe<Opaque<"string">>>` to a small fixed vector of plain
strings, which the toolkit's CLI arguments can express.
